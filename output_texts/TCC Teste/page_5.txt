ABSTRACT

The digital gaming industry has experienced significant growth in recent years,
and the Brazilian market is no exception. With the advancement of technology and
the popularization of digital distribution platforms, such as Steam, it has become
essential to understand the behavior of Brazilian users in this environment.

Ih this context, this article describes an analysis of data from Brazilian users of
the Steam platform, using the API provided by the platform to gather information
about their gaming consumption habits. The resulting database was applied to the
Weka software, which is a data mining tool, in order to identify patterns and
interesting insights about the behavior of Brazilian users.

This finding may be relevant to both the Steam platform and game developers,
providing insights into the behavior of the Brazilian market. Developers can adjust
their pricing and content strategies to better cater to the preferences of Brazilian
users. Additionally, Steam can target specific marketing campaigns to this audience,
highlighting lower-value games and offering additional benefits to encourage greater
engagement.

This analysis demonstrates the usefulness of the Steam API for collecting
valuable user data and the effectiveness of the Weka software in mining this data.
The combination of these tools allows for deeper and more accurate analysis of user
behavior, providing valuable information for strategic decision-making and service

personalization in the gaming industry.
